                    <p>
                        With social media marketing often limited by short advertisement lengths, the goal was to create a 30-second ad suitable for social media segments to boost customer engagement and conversion.

                    <p>
                        When creating this piece, I was influenced by the older, more dramatic anti-cigarette campaign commercials of the early 2000s. These ads often used dramatic close-ups and tight shots, typically ending with a simple text flash. I wanted to add a more comedic twist at the end to make the message land effectively.

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        I set up the products from multiple angles while maintaining consistent cinematic lighting for each cut. I used both high-speed and slow-motion videography to increase drama. The footage was edited in Premiere Pro, with minor work in After Effects for the text flash at the end. Adobe Audition was used to finish the sound before completing the deliverables.

                    <p>
                        The final 30-second ad effectively captures attention with dramatic visuals and a humorous twist. It was well-received, completed on time and within budget, and met the project's objectives.

                    <p>
                        The goal of this project was to create a 45-second promotional animation to help prospective students understand Graphic Information Technology (GIT). Many incoming students struggle to see how the program blends design, creativity, and technology, so the aim was to produce a short, engaging piece that clearly communicates the program’s identity and encourages exploration.

                    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>
                        The original concept combined live-action footage with animated elements, but early testing revealed it lacked cohesion. The project shifted to a fully animated piece, drawing from modern motion-graphics styles with clean vector shapes, bold transitions, and ASU’s brand identity. The result is energetic, approachable, and visually consistent with the ASU brand guide.

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project began with ideation, character sketches, and mood-board development to explore how to visually represent the creative and technical sides of the GIT program. After reviewing prototypes, a fully animated approach proved stronger.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Animation was produced in After Effects at 24 fps to match traditional animation pacing. Motion curves, easing, and subtle blurs were refined to create smooth, natural movement. The Puppet tool was used for character animation, and all typography and color choices followed ASU’s brand standards for consistency. As skills developed, the workflow became faster and more precise, allowing for higher-quality results in less time.

                    <p>
                        The final 45-second promo communicates GIT’s core identity with clean vector design, smooth motion, and on-brand styling. It provides an accessible introduction for prospective students, met project goals, was well-received, and demonstrated strong growth in animation technique and efficiency. It was highly praised and completed on time and within budget.

                        This work blends candid shots with high-fidelity close-ups. The goal was to create something playful, drawing inspiration from Animal Planet-style documentaries.

                    <p>
                        The process involved several moving parts: obtaining permission to film not only my dog but also other dogs, as well as gathering interviews from event organizers and workers. I set up and filmed in spaces that minimized distractions for the dogs while framing them effectively. I also arranged and shot the intro scenes, ensuring proper lighting. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Post-production was completed in Premiere Pro, where I edited the video. Finally I recorded and narrated the film in Adobe Audition, fine-tuning the audio for clarity and balance.
